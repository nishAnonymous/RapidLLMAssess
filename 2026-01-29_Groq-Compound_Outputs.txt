### How the sentence is built  

| Element | Ojibwe form | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **I** (subject) | **ni‑** | The prefix *ni‑* marks first‑person singular on the verb. |
| **listen** (verb root) | **‑sidot‑** | The root *sidot* means “to listen, to hear.” |
| **‑ang** (present‑progressive suffix) | **‑ang** | Adds the meaning “I am … / I am doing …” (present‑continuous). |
| **carefully** (adverb) | **weweni** | An adverb meaning “carefully, properly, with attention.” |
| **to you** (object, dative) | **kiin** | The dative (to‑form) of the second‑person singular pronoun “you.” |

Putting the pieces together:

1. **ni‑ + sidot + ‑ang** → **nisidotang** = “I am listening.”  
2. **weweni** is placed after the verb (Ojibwe commonly puts adverbs after the verb) → “listening carefully.”  
3. **kiin** is the dative pronoun “to you,” attached at the end of the clause.

Thus **Nisidotang weweni kiin** literally means “I am listening carefully to you.”

#### Alternative wording  

Some speakers also use the verb **bizindam** (“to listen”) with the same prefixes and suffixes:

```
Ninibizindam weweni kiin.
```

Both forms are grammatical; the choice between *sidot* and *bizind* is a matter of dialectal preference. The structure and meaning remain the same.

## How the sentence is built

| English | Ojibwe | Gloss (word‑by‑word) | Comments |
|---------|--------|----------------------|----------|
| I am tired | **nindayekoz** | **ni‑n‑daye‑koz** | *ni‑* = 1st‑person singular subject prefix. *‑n‑* is a linking element that appears before a verb stem beginning with a consonant. *daye* = “to be tired”. *‑koz* is the present‑tense (independent) ending meaning “‑s / is”.  Ojibwe does not use a separate copular verb *to be*; the state is expressed directly by the verb. |
| I am going to sleep | **niwii‑nibaa** | **ni‑wii‑nibaa** | *ni‑* = 1st‑person singular subject prefix. *‑wii‑* = future‑intentional (≈ “going to / will”). *nibaa* = “to sleep”. The whole form is an **independent** verb meaning “I will sleep / I am going to sleep”. |

### Key grammatical points

1. **Personal prefix** – Ojibwe verbs are marked for the subject (and sometimes the object) by a prefix.  
   * *ni‑* = “I” (1st‑person singular).  
   When the verb stem begins with a consonant, a linking *‑n‑* is inserted (as in *nindayekoz*).

2. **Verb stem** –  
   * *daye* = “to be tired”.  
   * *nibaa* = “to sleep”.

3. **Tense / aspect suffixes** –  
   * *‑koz* (or *‑k‑oz*) is the present‑tense ending used in independent clauses.  
   * *‑wii‑* is the future‑intentional prefix meaning “will, going to”. It is placed **after** the personal prefix and **before** the verb stem.

4. **No copula** – English needs the verb *to be* (“I am …”), but Ojibwe normally expresses a state directly with the appropriate verb. Hence *nindayekoz* literally means “I‑tired‑am” rather than “I am tired”.

5. **Punctuation** – A comma can be used in writing to separate the two independent clauses, just as in English, but it is not required by Ojibwe grammar.

---

### Putting it together

- **Nindayekoz** → “I am tired.”  
- **Niwii‑nibaa** → “I am going to sleep / I will sleep.”

When said in one breath the two clauses are simply placed side‑by‑side:

> **Nindayekoz, niwii‑nibaa.**  

This conveys the full meaning of the English sentence “I am tired, I am going to sleep.”

**Ojibwe (Anishinaabemowin) translation**

```
Giishkwaadawen mawanji’idiiwin.
```

*or, with the “completion” pre‑verb that is often used in English‑to‑Ojibwe renderings*

```
Mii‑ishkwaadawen mawanji’idiiwin.
```

## How the sentence is built  

| Element | Ojibwe form | What it means / grammatical role |
|---------|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| **gi‑** | 1st‑person **inclusive** (we) prefix | Marks the subject as “we” (including the listener). |
| **ishkwaa‑** | verb root “to end, to adjourn” | The core meaning of the action. |
| **‑da‑** | thematic vowel (used with many VAI‑type verbs) | Connects the root to the personal ending. |
| **‑wen** | present‑indicative ending for **animate plural** subjects | Gives the meaning “are …ing” (present progressive) with a plural animate subject (we). |
| **mawanji’idiiwin** | noun “meeting, council” | The object of the verb. |
| **mii‑** (optional) | pre‑verb meaning “already / now / indeed” | Often added to give the sense of “we are now ending” or “we have ended”. It does not change the core grammatical relations. |

Putting the pieces together:

- **gi‑ishkwaa‑da‑wen** = “we are ending” (the verb already contains the subject, tense, and aspect).  
- **mawanji’idiiwin** = “the meeting”.  

Thus **Giishkwaadawen mawanji’idiiwin** literally reads “We‑end‑(present) the‑meeting”, i.e. “We are ending the meeting”.

If you want to stress that the action is taking place right now, you can prepend the pre‑verb **mii‑**, giving **Mii‑ishkwaadawen mawanji’idiiwin** – “Now we are ending the meeting”.

### A few notes on Ojibwe verb morphology  

1. **Polysynthetic nature** – Ojibwe verbs often pack the subject, object (if any), tense, aspect, and mood into a single word.  
2. **Person prefixes** –  
   * **gi‑** = 1st‑person inclusive (we, including the listener)  
   * **ni‑** = 1st‑person exclusive (we, not including the listener)  
   * **gi‑** can also appear as **gi‑** before a vowel‑initial root; after a consonant it may surface as **gi‑** or **gi‑** depending on dialect.  
3. **Verb class** – “ishkwaa‑” is a **VAI** (intransitive) verb; it does not take a direct object, so the noun “meeting” follows the verb as a separate noun phrase.  
4. **Present‑indicative ending** – **‑wen** is the ending for animate plural subjects in the present indicative. For a singular “I” it would be **‑n**, for “you (singular)” **‑g**, etc.  

---

### Alternative wording you may encounter  

- **Ishkwaataadaa** – an imperative/plural “let’s end (the meeting)”. This is used when the speaker is giving a suggestion or command to a group.  
- **Giishkwaadawen** – the declarative “we are ending”.  

Both are correct; the choice depends on whether you want a statement of fact (the translation above) or a suggestion/command.
