## How the sentence is built  

| Part | Ojibwe word(s) | Gloss | Explanation |
|------|----------------|-------|-------------|
| **adverb “carefully”** | **giiwitaaw** | *carefully* | An adverb formed from the verb *wiitaaw* “to be careful, to take care.” The prefix **gii‑** marks it as a neutral‑time adverb (it can be used with either past or non‑past statements). |
| **verb “listen”** | **gikendaamin** | *I listen‑to‑you* | The verb stem is **kendaam‑** “to listen, to pay attention.” <br>• **gi‑** – second‑person (you) **object prefix** (the person being listened to). <br>• **‑in** – first‑person **subject suffix** (I). <br>Thus **gikendaamin** = “I listen to you.” |
| **object pronoun “you”** | **gi** | *to you* | In many contexts the object pronoun can appear as an independent clitic after the verb for emphasis or clarity. Here it repeats the object already marked by the prefix **gi‑**, reinforcing that the speaker is listening *to you*. It is common in conversational Ojibwe to keep the clitic, especially when the verb is preceded by an adverb. |
| **overall word order** | **Adverb – Verb – Object‑clitic** | – | Ojibwe is a **verb‑first** (VSO) language, but adverbs and particles that modify the whole clause often appear before the verb. The optional object clitic follows the verb. |

### Putting it together  

1. **giiwitaaw** – “carefully” modifies the whole clause.  
2. **gikendaamin** – the core verb “I listen to you” (subject = first person, object = second person).  
3. **gi** – an optional clitic that repeats the object and makes the reference to the addressee explicit.  

When spoken quickly, many speakers simply say **gikendaamin gi** (“I’m listening to you”). Adding **giiwitaaw** stresses that the listening is attentive or careful, matching the English “listening carefully.”  

---

### Alternative phrasing

- **Gikendaamin gi.** – “I’m listening to you.” (without the “carefully” nuance)  
- **Giiwitaaw gi‑kendaamin.** – A slightly different ordering that some dialects prefer; the meaning is the same.  

Both versions are understood throughout the Anishinaabe language community, and speakers may vary the exact shape depending on dialect (e.g., Ojibwemowin of the Central, Northern, or Southwestern groups).

### Word‑by‑word breakdown

| Ojibde | English gloss | Explanation |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| **ni‑** | *I* (first‑person prefix) | The prefix **ni‑** marks a verb or stative adjective as being performed by the speaker. |
| **mazin** | *tired* (stative adjective) | **mazin** means “tired, weary”. When a stative adjective is used with a personal prefix it functions like a predicate: *ni‑mazin* = “I am tired”. |
| **,** | – | The comma separates the two clauses. |
| **wii‑** | *I‑will / I‑am going to* (first‑person future/intentional prefix) | **wii‑** is the future/intentional prefix for the first person. It indicates that the action is planned or imminent. |
| **zhigaade** | *go* (verb *izhi‑gag* “to go”) | The root **gag** means “to go”. In the future form **zhigaade** the **‑zh‑** (or **‑zh‑**) marks the verb as a future/intentional action and the **‑‑ade** ending makes it a simple present‑future “go”. |
| **nishkaadendam** | *to sleep* (verb *shkaadend‑* “to lie down, to go to sleep”) | **shkaadend** is the verb “to lie down, to go to sleep”. The first‑person prefix **ni‑** plus the future/intentional prefix **‑‑** is already expressed in **wii‑zhigaade**, so the verb here appears as a **noun‑like infinitive** that follows the auxiliary “go”. In many dialects the construction “wii‑zhigaade *[verb]*” is used to mean “I am going to *[verb]*”. |

Putting the pieces together:

* **Ni‑mazin** → “I am tired.”  
* **Wii‑zhigaade nishkaadendam** → literally “I‑will‑go (to) sleep”, i.e., “I am going to sleep”.

---

### Why this construction is natural in Ojibwe

1. **Stative predicates** – In Anishinaabemowin, adjectives that describe a state (tired, cold, hungry, etc.) are treated as stative verbs. Adding the personal prefix (**ni‑**) makes the predicate a complete sentence: *ni‑mazin* = “I am tired”.

2. **Future/intentional auxiliary** – The prefix **wii‑** is the canonical way to say “I will / I am about to”. When combined with the verb *gag* “to go” and the infinitive form of another verb, it creates the periphrastic “be going to” construction that English uses.

3. **Infinitive‑like verb form** – The verb *shkaadend* (“to lie down, to go to sleep”) can appear in a bare form after **wii‑zhigaade**, much like an English infinitive after “going to”. This is a common pattern across the various Ojibwe dialects (Central, Southwestern, Northwestern, etc.).

---

### Dialectal notes

* **mazin** (tired) is stable across most dialects, but you may also see **mazina’igan** (become tired) in some communities.  
* The “going‑to” construction can also be rendered with **wii‑zhii‑** + verb, e.g., **wii‑zhii‑shkaadendam**, which is more common in some Northwestern speakers.  
* Some speakers prefer the simple future **wii‑shkaadendam** (“I will sleep”) rather than the periphrastic “go‑to‑sleep” form. Both are grammatical and understood.

Feel free to adjust the spelling to the orthography used in your community (double‑vowel, “ojibwemowin” vs. “ojibwe”, etc.). The grammatical analysis above holds for all of them.

PHRASE: "We are ending the meeting"

===========================================

**Ojibwe (Anishinaabemowin) translation**

```
Giin dash gii‑izhi‑giizhag gikendaman.
```

---

### Word‑by‑word breakdown  

| Ojibwe element | English gloss | Notes on form / function |
|----------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| **Giin**       | we (inclusive) | First‑person plural pronoun. In many dialects *giin* is used for “we (including the listener)”. |
| **dash**       | (progressive) | The progressive marker that turns a simple present verb into “‑ing”. It is placed **before** the verb complex. |
| **gii‑**       | past‑tense preverb (here used as a “realis” preverb) | In a present‑progressive clause it often appears as part of a compound preverb to give a sense of a completed‐in‑the‑making action. |
| **izhi‑**      | reflexive/benefactive preverb | Means “to do something to/for oneself (or for the group)”. In the construction *gii‑izhi‑* the speaker signals that the action is being carried out by the subject on the object. |
| **giizhag**    | “to end, to finish” (verb root *‑zhag* “to end”) | The stem *‑zhag* is the basic verb meaning “to end”. With the preceding preverbs it becomes “are ending”. |
| **gikendaman** | “the meeting, the gathering” | Noun formed from the verb *gikendaas‑* “to gather”. The suffix *‑an* marks a concrete object (the thing that is gathered/assembled). |

Putting the pieces together:

- **Giin dash** → “We are …”
- **gii‑izhi‑giizhag** → “ending (it)”, literally “we are (self‑)finishing”. The preverbs *gii‑* (real­is) + *izhi‑* (reflexive) modify the verb *giizhag*.
- **gikendaman** → “the meeting”.

Hence the whole sentence means **“We are ending the meeting.”**

---

### Why the sentence looks the way it does

1. **Subject pronoun** – Ojibwe can be a pro‑drop language, but the pronoun *giin* is kept here for clarity, especially in a teaching context.

2. **Progressive marker *dash*** – In most Central‑ and Southern‑Ojibwe dialects the present‑progressive is formed with *dash* + verb. Some speakers may also use *gii‑dash* or simply the verb without *dash*; the form shown is the most widely understood.

3. **Verb complex** – Ojibwe verbs are built from a **preverb** (or series of preverbs) plus a **verb root**.  
   - *gii‑* signals that the event is real/actual rather than hypothetical.  
   - *izhi‑* adds the reflexive/benefactive nuance (“we do it ourselves / for ourselves”).  
   - *‑zhag* is the lexical root “to end, to finish”.

4. **Object noun** – The noun *gikendaman* is a **noun derived from a verb** (a “verbal noun”). It literally means “the gathering” and serves as the object of the verb “to end”. In Ojibwe the object generally follows the verb, as shown.

---

### Variation you might also hear

- **Giin dash gii‑izhi‑giizhag a’aw** – using *a’aw* (“it, that”) as a pronoun for “the meeting” instead of the full noun.  
- **Giin dash gii‑izhi‑giizhag waabishkaa** – in some dialects *waabishkaa* is used for “meeting, council”.

All of these alternatives convey the same basic meaning: *“We are ending the meeting.”*
