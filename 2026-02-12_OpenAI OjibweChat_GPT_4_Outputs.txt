TIMESTAMP: 2/12/2026  2:03:00 PM
===========================================
English: "I am listening carefully to you" Ojibwe: "Niin gikendaan gwayak ge-izhi-gagwejimin"

Pronunciation: [neen gee-ken-daan gwa-yahk geh-ih-zhee-gah-gway-jih-min]

Notes: In this translation:

"Niin" means "I" indicating the first person.
"Gikendaan" means "listening," with a nuance of understanding or knowing.
"Gwayak" means "carefully" or "correctly."
"Ge-izhi-gagwejimin" involves "izhi-gagwejim," referring to the act of questioning or talking directly, and it is conjugated to imply "to you" (addressing someone else directly).
The sentence uses the polysynthetic nature of Ojibwe, where multiple elements are combined into a single expression to convey the phrase.

TEST: Test 2
PHRASE: "I am tired, I am going to sleep"
TIMESTAMP: 2/12/2026  2:04:00 PM
===========================================
Ojibwe: "Ninanda-giiwose, nimibiz."

Pronunciation: [nih-nuhn-dah ghee-woh-seh, nih-mih-biz]

Notes:

"Ninanda-giiwose" translates to "I am tired." The prefix "ni-" indicates the first person (I), "nanda-" relates to feeling or being in a state of distress, and "giiwose" means being tired.
"Nimibiz" translates to "I am going to sleep." Again, "ni-" is the prefix for the first person, and "mibiz" pertains to sleeping.
This sentence structure begins with the expressions of states of being or actions related to the subject "I" (ni- prefix), following the polysynthetic nature of Ojibwe to combine prefixes and verb stems to convey full ideas succinctly.

TEST: Test 3
PHRASE: "We are ending the meeting"
TIMESTAMP: 2/12/2026  2:06:00 PM
===========================================
English: "We are ending the meeting" Ojibwe: "Gii-maajiidaadidaa omaa jiigewining."

Pronunciation: [gee-mah-zhee-dah-dee-dah oh-mah zee-ge-win-ing]

Notes:

"Gii-" is a past tense marker but in this context can be used to show the completion of an action.
"maajiidaadidaa" means "we are starting to go" or initiating something, tailored here to imply "ending" by context when combined with "jiigewining."
"omaa" means "here" or "this place," indicating the location of the action.
"jiigewining" refers to a "meeting" or a place where people come together.
The grammatical structure reflects Ojibwe's polysynthetic nature, condensing the phrase into fewer words that imply collective action and location within the context of a meeting.
