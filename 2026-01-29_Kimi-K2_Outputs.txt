Ojibwe (Anishinaabemowin)  
“Ninandawaabamaa gaye ningikendan.”

Literal breakdown  
- ni- … -n  → 1st-sg subject marker on the verb  
- nandawaabamaa  → “listen to” (someone) (VTA, “look-listen” toward a person)  
- gaye  → “and / also”  
- ningikendan  → “I take care / I am careful / I do it carefully” (VAI, 1st-sg)

So the sentence says: “I listen to you and (I) am-careful,” i.e. “I am listening carefully to you.”

PHRASE: "I am tired, I am going to sleep"
TIMESTAMP: 1/29/2026  1:56:00 PM
===========================================

Ojibwe (Anishinaabemowin) translation:

Nibaawagad nindibik.

Literal word-by-word gloss:

1. nibaawagad – “it is tiring / I am tired”
  - nibaaw- (root “sleep, be asleep”)
  - ‑wagad (intransitive VAI third-person conjunct form that carries the sense “it is …-ing to me”)
2. nindibik – “I am going to sleep / I will sleep”
  - ni- (1st-sing. prefix “I”)
  - ‑dibik (verb stem “sleep, go to sleep”)

So the sentence is built with two verbs: the first expresses the state of being tired, the second expresses the intention to sleep.

PHRASE: "We are ending the meeting"
TIMESTAMP: 1/29/2026  1:57:00 PM
===========================================

Ojibwe (Anishinaabemowin) translation:

**"Gii-wiidookaagewaad ending"** — or, more idiomatically:

**"Gii-wiidookaagewaad imaa gaa-izhaayan"**  
literally: “We are finished (with) where we were going/holding (it).”

But the simplest, most natural way to say “We are ending the meeting” is:

**“Gii-wiidookaagewaad.”**  
“We have finished (the) meeting / We are done with the meeting.”

-------------------------------------------------
Grammatical notes

1. **gii-** – past/complete aspect marker (“have …-ed”).  
2. **wiidookaage** – VAI verb stem meaning “to meet/assemble/hold a council.”  
3. **-waad** – 3-plural conjunct ending used in independent clauses in some Ojibwe dialects (especially northern ones) to signal “they/we” animate plural.  In many conversational communities the same idea is rendered with the simple plural **-wag** → **gii-wiidookaagewag** “they have met / the meeting is over.”  
4. Because Ojibwe doesn’t need a separate pronoun, the subject “we” is contained in the verb ending.  
5. There is no stand-alone noun that means “meeting,” so the verb itself carries the idea “hold/attend a meeting.”  When the action is completed, the sentence doubles as “the meeting is ended.”

So, in everyday speech you simply announce:

**Gii-wiidookaagewaad.**  
“We are done with the meeting / The meeting is ended.”
