===========================================
A common Ojibwe way to say “I am listening carefully to you” is:

**Giin gigoonitaa.**

Literally, this is closer to “I am listening to you” or “I hear you,” and speakers typically rely on voice and context to convey “carefully” or “attentively.” Different communities and dialects may use slightly different verbs or add adverbs, so this is one natural, concise option rather than the only “correct” one.

### Grammatical structure (basic)

- **Giin** – “you” (independent second-person pronoun).  
- **gigoonitaa** – verb meaning roughly “I am listening to you / I hear you,” where:
  - **gi-** marks second person (“you” as the person acted on),
  - the verb stem relates to hearing/listening,
  - the first-person subject “I” is built into the verb (Ojibwe normally marks person on the verb rather than with separate subject pronouns).

To make the idea of “carefully” or “attentively” stronger, some speakers might add an adverb such as **mashkawaa** (“strongly, intently”) or use a fuller sentence depending on dialect, so if you are learning in a specific community, it’s good to check with a local speaker or teacher for their preferred form.

PHRASE: "I am tired, I am going to sleep"

===========================================
Here’s a faithful translation and explanation of your phrase:  

> **Ojibwe (Anishinaabemowin):** *Nindanayekoz, nindoonjibaa nibaa.*

However, the more natural way to say “I am tired, I am going to sleep” in conversational Ojibwe is:

> **Common form:** *Nindanayekoz, gaanoogomaa nibaa.*  
> (literally: “I am tired, now I’m going to sleep.”)

### Grammatical breakdown

- **Nindanayekoz**  
  - *nind-* = first-person prefix (“I”)  
  - *anayekoz* = “to be tired” (verb, stative intransitive)  
  → Together: *nindanayekoz* = “I am tired.”

- **Nibaa**  
  - A verb meaning “to sleep.”  
  - In Ojibwe, the subject “I” is often implied through context or verb morphology, so you can just say *nibaa* (it means “I’m sleeping / I will sleep”).

- **Gaanoogomaa**  
  - An adverb meaning “now” or “soon.”  
  - Optional, adds a more natural flow.

Ojibwe verbs include information about who is doing the action inside the word itself—there’s no need for separate pronouns like “I” or “am.” So each verb already carries subject and tense information depending on prefixes and endings.

### Example in context
A speaker might say:
> *Nindanayekoz. Nibaa gaa-pii.*  
> “I’m tired. I’ll sleep soon.”

PHRASE: "We are ending the meeting"
TIMESTAMP: 2/12/2026  2:16:00 PM
===========================================
Here is a concise Ojibwe (Anishinaabemowin) translation and a brief note on structure.

Translation
- We are ending the meeting: Giziibiigaaniiwagad akiing*?* (common, literal forms vary)
- A more natural, commonly used version: Ishkwaataadaa giwii-dazhindaamin daabi’igan inaawemaagoowin? (Let’s end the meeting now) 
- Another approachable option: Giwii-dazhindaa minikwi-biin mandamaan? (Shall we end the meeting now?)

Grammatical notes
- Ojibwe often expresses “ending/adjournment” with verbs in the inclusive first-person plural or imperative forms, depending on whether the speaker includes the listener.
- The verb endings can mark tense/aspect and include a mood that covers a collective action (we/end/adjourn).
- There isn’t a single fixed word for “meeting end”; speakers use verb phrases like “let us end” or “let us adjourn,” sometimes adding time adverbs like “now” to anchor the action.

If you’d like, I can tailor the translation to a specific dialect variant (e.g., a particular community’s usage) or provide a small pronunciation guide.
